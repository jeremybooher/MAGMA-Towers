Invariants in Zp Towers

Files:
tower_computation provides basic methods for describing curves in a Zp tower of curves over a field of charactersitic p and computing with the Cartier operator on the space of regular differentials.
tower_data uses tower_computation to collect data about Zp towers with different ramification
example_finder will select interesting examples of Zp towers where the invariant of the first level takes on different values, and then collects data up the tower.  (It also includes functions for dealing with Z/pZ covers.)
data_storage stores the results of the computations (copied and pasted as they are run), as individual examples can take several days
data_storage_small stores many more examples where fewer levels of the tower are analyzed
data_analysis provides some functions for analyzing the stored computations, producing tables, and checking conjectures
